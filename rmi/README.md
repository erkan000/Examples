### Remote Method Invocation
Remote Method Invocation (RMI) is an API which allows an object to invoke a method on an object that exists in another address space, which could be on the same machine or on a remote machine. 

Inside the server program, a remote object is created and reference of that object is made available for the client (using the registry).

The client program requests the remote objects on the server and tries to invoke its methods.


### Usage
- Run RMIServer.java as a Java program 
- Run from anywhere RMIClient.java as java program, you need only interface

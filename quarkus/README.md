### Quarkus First Demo

From https://quarkus.io/ 
"A Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot and GraalVM, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards."

This is a very basic Quarkus sample app

#### Usage:
- Copy project
- mvn clean compile
- mvn quarkus:dev (Read stopping server section)
- Navigate to http://localhost:8080/
- Navigate to http://localhost:8080/quarkus
- Web components frontend added, navigate to http://localhost:8080/demo.html

- mvn quarkus:list-extensions	Lists extensions(e.g quarkus-resteasy-jsonb)

#### Notes
- With Quarkus, there is no need to create an Application class. Itâ€™s supported, but not required. In addition, only one instance of the resource is created and not one per request. You can configure this using the different *Scoped annotations (ApplicationScoped, RequestScoped, etc).

#### Stopping server
 In documentation dev server can be stopped by "CTRL+C", but in Eclipse, shortcut doesn't works. (https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/587605/)
 
 Solution is to use "@QuarkusMain" annotation, so you can start and stop quarkus like a spring boot project. Only run Main.java!, thats it.
 
 Json parsing is done by "quarkus-resteasy-jsonb" dependency.

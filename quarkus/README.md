### Quarkus First Demo

From https://quarkus.io/ 
"A Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot and GraalVM, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards."

This is a very basic Quarkus sample app

#### Usage:
- Copy project
- mvn clean compile
- mvn quarkus:dev
- Navigate to http://localhost:8080/
- Navigate to http://localhost:8080/quarkus

#### Notes
- With Quarkus, there is no need to create an Application class. Itâ€™s supported, but not required. In addition, only one instance of the resource is created and not one per request. You can configure this using the different *Scoped annotations (ApplicationScoped, RequestScoped, etc).
